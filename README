Programs to calculate/extract bindingenergies

Suggested usage:

1. Calculate various vacancy states using "calc_listZ.pl"
2. Extract energies for calculated states using "getenergies_multiZ.pl"

If FAILED-CALC.LOG created, check individual cases and re-run appropriate
programs as stand-alone. 

Outfile is appended to ENERGY.DAT. Check file and see if values missing. If
so, check individual cases and re-run programs as stand-alone.

--- Program/files ---

calc_singelvac.pl
	Calculate single vacancy. Create subdirectory structure for calculations
	using "Z-element-A/vacancy". No files removed. All inputfiles to other
	programs stored in "log"-directory. It is possible to manually run all
	Graps2018 programs using the inputfiles (to debug?). Note direcotry "FO"
	created for no vacancy (FO, FullOrbital). 

calc_multivac.pl
	Calls "calc_singlevac.pl"
	Calculate multiple vacancies for given atom.
	Directories/files for failed calculations removed. In case of failed
	calculations, try run specific calculation using "calc_singlevad.pl"
	alone (which also does now remove subdirs). 

calc_listZ.pl
	Input a list Z and calls "calc_multivac.pl" for each Z. 
	Calculates all vacancies using most abundant istope for each Z in list. 

getenergies_singleZ.pl
	Get energies for given Z and vacancies. When obtained energy values
	check energies and mixing coefficient. Use one of following
	methods	to get get the value for given vacancy (default #1, modify code
	to change):
	
	1. "purest" state configuration
	   Extract energies for given vacancy and choose the one that has
	   highest value for mixing coefficient. In case of same value for
	   mixing coefficient (e.g. mix = 1.000) set the value to the lowest
	   energy.

	2. lowest energy 
	   Extract energies for given vacancy and choose the one that has
	   the lowest energy.  

getenergies_multiZ.pl
	Input a list of Z calls "getenergies_singleZ.pl" for each Z. 
	Get energies for several atoms and several vacancies.
        Output is printed/append to file.

atomconfig_all.txt
	List of neutral atoms sorted by increasing Z. Mass number (A)
	taken for most abundant isotope. Configuration listed is used
	for calculations with Graps2018. Note the configuration not
	always in order e.g. 5p(6)4f(7)6s(2) where 4f listed after 5p.

rmixextract_rdr.f90
	To allow for longer configuration lists in output from rmixextract
	need a few changes in original .f90 file. Changes done seem to work.
	Recompile and put in same directory as original.

rcsfgenerate90ver2
	Need to do changes in rcsfgenerate to allow for more subshells. Per
	default only 20? subshells allowed. Replace/recombile with updated
	files (tarball exist: rcsfgenerate90ver2.tar.gz)



#####  Change log  #####

2020-03-05
	First version ready and shipped

2020-03-09
	JÃ¶rgen fix new version of "rcsfgenerate", which allow calculations with
	CSF-lists for heavier system with open inner shells.

2020-03-12
	Fix 'FO' works properly. 'Radioactive atoms' atoms, with A listed with * in
	"atomconfig_all.txt" now should work properly.
